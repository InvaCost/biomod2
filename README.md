- all documentation and examples have been cleaned up

#### <i class="fas fa-plus-square"></i> What is new ?

- plot functions have been re-written with `ggplot2`
- [`biomod2` website](https://biomodhub.github.io/biomod2/) has been created, with proper `roxygen2` documentation and help vignettes

#### <i class="fas fa-question-circle"></i> But... why ?

- “*For every minute spent on organizing, an hour is earned.*” — Benjamin Franklin
  - better documentation, better formation, better help provided
